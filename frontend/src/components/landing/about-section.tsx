                        We understand the unique challenges Guatemalan students face when
                        applying for US scholarships. Language barriers, limited access to
                        information, and lack of guidance shouldn&apos;t stand in the way of
                        your dreams.

                        GuateAbroad was created by students who&apos;ve been through the
                        process, for students who are just starting. Our mission is to
                        democratize access to opportunities and build a supportive community
                        that helps each other succeed.
